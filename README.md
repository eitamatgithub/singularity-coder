# Singularity: Utility-Driven Autonomous Code Generator

**Singularity** or (**SING**le-prompted **U**tility-driven **L**LM-based **A**utonomous **R**untime)-ity is an audacious autonomous code generator designed primarily for building POCs, research prototypes, experimental workflows and other excuses for using Google Colab notebooks :). It is built on top of Cursor and uses real Colab runtime execution feedback in a LangGraph agent loop to iteratively refine generated code until satisfactory results (or a hard stop) are reached - Combining the power of Cursor and Google Colab together. The main challenge this library aims to address is optimizing the iterative execution–feedback loop, with a primary focus on defining what constitutes satisfactory results and dynamically modeling a clear, testable Definition of Done (DoD) for each task.

## TL;DR — READ THIS BEFORE USING THE CODE

**You must read and understand this entire section before using Singularity.**

Singularity can operate in **two execution modes**:

#### 1. `safe-interactive`
Every code execution requires explicit user approval.  
This is the recommended mode.

#### 2. `blind-autonomous`
Execution–feedback iterations run fully unattended until convergence or a predefined stop condition. This mode is **disabled by default** and requires explicitly modifying the code to enable it, as it carries inherent security risks. 
If your project requires a large number of iterations and/or you intend to scale execution, and you are familiar with the type of code generated by Singularity (both the solution and the unit tests) for your prompts, and are willing to assume full responsibility for the risks of blindly executing generated code, you may consider using this mode.



### ⚠️ Security Model & Usage Requirements

Do not use Singularity in any mode for malicious or adverserial purposes, cyber-attack–related prompts, or jailbreaking attempts. If you do so, you assume full responsibility for your actions; the Singularity authors and contributors bear no responsibility or liability.

In any mode, if you take the final output, or any intermediate artifact, produced by the code generation process outside the sterile environment for real-world use, ensure that the code is carefully reviewed before execution.

In all cases, any jailbreaking, malicious, adversarial, or otherwise unsafe behavior resulting from the use or misuse of Singularity is the sole responsibility of the user. The Singularity authors and contributors expressly disclaim any liability for damages, misuse, or harmful activity arising from such actions. If your project touches on or approaches such areas, it is your sole responsibility to carefully review all generated code before each execution. If you are unsure whether your prompt might unintentionally produce such code, err on the side of caution: review every iteration and do not use **blind-autonomous** mode.


The remainder of this section applies to who intend to use **blind-autonomous** mode.

The blind-autonomous mode carries inherent security risks and **must only be used in a sterile, disposable environment**.

The code was tested in Google Colab, if you want to run it in another sterile enviorment, read the guidlines below, but do not run it in blind-autonomous mode on your personal hard drive - **this is highly not recommended**. 

The recommended setup is a **clean Google Colab runtime** with:
- No access to Google Drive
- No access to local or persistent credentials - unless you are willing to take the risk
- Minimal scoped API access only

For example, My personal setup uses:
- a **Cursor API key** (required)
- a **read-only Hugging Face token** (for my use cases)
I am fully aware of the hypothetical possibility that even a read-only token could be accessed by generated code and transmitted to Cursor or to another external endpoint.

Additionally, do not use blind-autonomous mode with API tokens tied to pay-as-you-go or usage-based billing accounts for any service.



This isolation model is intended to minimize risk in pathological or adversarial scenarios—such as code generated by cursor misusing its own API access or attempting unintended network activity. While such behavior is unlikely under normal use, **deliberately jailbreaking the agent may produce unsafe outcomes**. 


Running blind-autonomous mode outside of Colab is **not recommended** unless you:
- build an equivalent sterile environment (e.g. MicroVMs), or
- are an experienced Docker user who fully understands and accepts the risks


If you're eager to try blind mode anyaway - a good practice would be to first see if your projects run in so much iterations that justifies not reviewing them. But note - it is possible that the fact that singularity sends cursor reports on specific task will fine tune the agent's 
user specific resources, so running the same or similar tasks over and over might make singularity run in less iterations.



### Safety Defaults & Legal Notice

To reduce accidental misuse and limit liability:

- Both the library and example notebook ship with  
  `ALLOW_BLIND_EXECUTION = False` hardcoded
- Enabling blind-autonomous mode requires **explicitly modifying the supplied code**
- This ensures users consciously opt in to unattended execution

## Project Status

As to the current commit, Singularity is still a WORK IN PROGRESS and *not a stable release.

- APIs may change without notice
- Behavior may be incomplete or incorrect
- Generated code should be reviewed before real-world use

**You are using this project entirely at your own risk.**

## Privacy & Data Handling

Singularity is an open-source library, but it operates on top of Cursor and therefore inherits Cursor’s data-handling and privacy model.

Please be aware of the following:

1. **Prompt transmission**  
   All prompts, feedback, and generated context processed by Singularity are ultimately **sent to Cursor** via the Cursor CLI. Singularity itself does not intercept, store, or independently transmit this data beyond what is required for execution and logging.

2. **Cursor account settings apply**  
   How your data is stored, retained, logged, or used for model improvement is determined entirely by your Cursor account configuration and preferences, not by Singularity. This includes any opt-in or opt-out settings related to data usage.

Singularity does **not** provide additional privacy guarantees beyond those offered by Cursor.  
Users are responsible for reviewing Cursor’s privacy policy and configuring their Cursor settings appropriately before using Singularity.

**Do not include secrets, private data, or sensitive information in prompts or notebook code unless you fully understand and accept the underlying data-handling policies of Cursor.**

## How to Use:
Use this notebook https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1b0-VVeX25O4AZxZsssvEMNuFcuAfEefx?usp=sharing (I will make it download the coder from github once it's public) it is shipped with an example prompt and solution. On the left bar go to secrets and fill your CURSOR_API_KEY, you can generate one using these instructions:

1. Log in to your **Cursor Dashboard**.
2. Navigate to the **Settings** tab (or **Integrations**, depending on your plan).
3. Locate the **User API Keys** or **Admin API Keys** section under **Advanced**.
4. Click **Create New API Key**, give it a name, and copy it immediately— it will not be shown again.
